Task:

Requests a noun

Converts singular nouns into plural nouns and prints

Do the best you can to account for irregular forms and exceptions.
You wonâ€™t be able to get them all, but you should be able to get
the program to catch most forms.

Comments:

This program is designed to get the singular form of a verb and convert it.
Due to the nature of the script there isn't as much error catching so please
verify that your spelling is correct. The program will run until 'quit' is
entered.

Enjoy!
